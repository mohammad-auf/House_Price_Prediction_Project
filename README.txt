Project Overview : Prediction of House Price


Predict the price of a house by its features. If you are a buyer or seller of the house but you don't know the exact price of the house, so supervised machine learning regression algorithms can help you to predict the price of the house just providing features of the target house.


Project Steps:

**House Price Prediction Project Steps:**

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Load the dataset containing information about residential properties, including features such as location, Total_SQF, Area, etc.
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and summary statistics related to house prices.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values by imputation or removal.
   - Perform feature scaling or transformation if necessary to normalize the data distribution.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Visualize the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features, relationships between variables, and potential outliers.
   - Plot histograms, and correlation to understand the relationships between features and house prices.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train various machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, SGDRegressor, KNeighborsRegressor, SVR, DecisionTreeRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, RandomForestRegressor,
     and XGBRegressor.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing data using appropriate evaluation metrics such as R-squared score.
   - Compare the predicted house prices with the actual house prices to assess the model's accuracy and generalization ability.

6. **Prediction:**
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data, such as the prices of houses in the test set or real-world scenarios.
   - Generate predictions for house prices based on the input features of new properties.

7. **Results Analysis:**
   - Analyze the predicted house prices and compare them with the actual selling prices to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness.
